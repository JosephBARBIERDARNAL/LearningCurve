    "### Brief description\n",
    "\n",
    "The OLS method is a very popular method in statistical modeling that tries to find the best fit between a continuous variable and several other variables. More formally, it consists in analytically solving the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Argmin_{\\beta}~\\sum_i^n r_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_i$ denotes the difference between what the model predicts for the observation $i_{th}$ and the true value of the observation $i_{th}$, also called residual.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily prove that the $\\beta$ that minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals, in the multivariate case, is the following estimator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat\\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the matrix of explanatory variables and $y$ is the continuous variable we want to model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have done this estimation, we have the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat y = X \\hat\\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to interpret a model and determine if it fits the data. We will look at just a few of them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting the coefficients**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interpret the estimated coefficients directly. Assuming this model $\\hat{income}_i = \\hat\\beta \\times education_i$, we can say that on average and all other things being equal (in the multivariate case), when the education variable increases by 1 (year, month or other), income tends to increase by $\\hat\\beta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test the null hypothesis that the coefficient $j_{th}$ is zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the following model: $\\hat y_i = \\hat\\beta_0 + \\hat\\beta_1 \\times income_i + \\hat\\beta_2 \\times age_i$ with $\\hat\\beta_1 = 2$ and $\\hat\\sigma_{\\hat\\beta_1} = 0.5$. Under certain assumptions (notably the distribution of residuals), we can test whether income has a significant impact on $y$ by testing whether $2$ is significantly different from $0$. To do this, we compute the following statistic: $t = \\frac{2}{0.5} = 4$. If the latter is greater (in absolute terms) than 1.96 (equivalent to p<0.05), we conclude that income has a significant impact on $y$ and we keep this variable in the model. Click [here](https://www.statistics-learning-curve.com/_files/ugd/ba568f_f0123d062580420b95daac9ec6e566f1.pdf) to see one of the limitations of this test. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficient of determination $R^2$**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method does not allow us to measure globally the quality of the model but only to test one variable at a time. On the contrary, the coefficient of determination tells us the quality of our model. We can see it as the percentage of variance explained: $R^2 = \\frac{\\sum_i^n (\\hat y_i - \\bar y_i)^2}{\\sum_i^n (y_i - \\bar y_i)^2}$. However, this statistic tends to increase \"artificially\" with the number of explanatory variables. For this, we use the adjusted coefficient of determination: $\\bar R^2 = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{n-k} (1 - R^2)$ with $n$ the sample size and $k$ the number of explanatory variables, including the intercept. The statistic no longer measures the percentage of variance explained, but only the measure of how well the model fits the data.\n",
